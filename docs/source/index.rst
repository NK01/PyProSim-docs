Welcome to PyProSim's documentation!
====================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.
PyProSim is described, which employs the accurate and reliable FactSage
thermodynamic databases and Gibbs Energy Minimizer to perform complex
multicomponent chemical reactions involving liquid metal, liquid oxide,
solid and gas phases, facilitating the design and optimization of any
metallurgical process/equipment.
