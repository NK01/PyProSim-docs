Welcome to PyProSim's documentation!
====================================

**PyProSim** is a general purpose metallurgical simulation tool, which employs
the accurate and reliable FactSage thermodynamic databases and Gibbs Energy
Minimizer to perform complex multicomponent chemical reactions involving
liquid metal, liquid oxide, solid and gas phases, facilitating the design and
optimization of any metallurgical process/equipment.

Although PyProSim has not yet been available as a commercial product for long,
it has already proven itself as a tool that offers significant advantage over
other process simulation software. The ability to combine *comprehensive*
multi-phase multi-component thermodynamic calculation with an *ease of use*
facilitated by its visual approach, makes it a *highly extensible tool* for
process model development.
