Installation Guide
===================

.. _installation:
PyProSim runs on any windows machine with minimal installation and is designed with a drag-and-drop
approach to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface

It is powered by accurate FactSage thermodynamic databases and ChemApp library to perform complex,
multicomponent, multiphase chemical equilibria and their associated extensive property balances

There are two steps to install PyProSim on your Windows computer:

#. Installation of ChemApp dongle.
#. Installation of PyProSim.

ChemApp
------------

FactSage installation is not required on the computer.
ChemApp, like FactSage, uses Sentinel USB dongles as software protection and licensing solution.
The drivers for the Sentinel dongles must be installed for ChemApp to work properly:
   * If you are already using a FactSage USB dongle, the Sentinel drivers are already installed on your computer. Attach the ChemApp dongle to the USB slot. The red light (LED) on the dongle should turn on
   * If you have never used a FactSage USB dongle, the drivers need to be installed. Attach the USB dongle to the computer. In most cases, the dongle will install itself. After a successful installation, the red light (LED) on the dongle should turn on

In case the drivers did not install correctly, you can install them manually using the file here: `ChemApp dongle driver <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xKtC850LyYp98Hz0jDfCaDvZ7nWUAh4E/view>`_

Follow the instructions given in the Sentinel installation wizard. You may have to reboot the computer at the
end of installation. It may take a while for the red light or LED of the dongle to light, then blink a while and then finally glow
constantly. When the red light is on, the dongle and the drivers are successfully installed.

PyProSim
------------

The PyProSim program is installed using the compressed (zip) file *PyProSim.zip*.
Simply decompress the content of the compressed file *PyProSim.zip* on your computer.
There is no restriction on the location of the program on your computer (it can be installed anywhere).
